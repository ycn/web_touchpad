# Web TouchPad

This tool provides a simple remote touchpad capability, including mouse movement, left-click, and right-click.

No client installation is required. Simply start the server and access the local network port, and you can use the touchpad remotely on any device.

Note: The 'public' directory needs to be copied to the same directory as the server executable.
